Next step involves installing [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/). You can install Helm by running the following command:

`curl https://baltocdn.com/helm/signing.asc | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https --yes
echo "deb https://baltocdn.com/helm/stable/debian/ all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/helm-stable-debian.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install helm
`{{execute}}

To check whether Helm is installed or not, execute the following command:

`helm version`{{execute}}
